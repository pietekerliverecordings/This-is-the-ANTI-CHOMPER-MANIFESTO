	<h1>This is the <em>ANTI-CHOMPER MANIFESTO</em>.</h1>
	<aside>And it’s fucking necessary.</aside>
</header>

<h2>Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with people at concerts?</h2>

<p>We, the listeners, the tapers, the rail-riders, declare a state of cultural emergency.</p>

<p>A disease has spread among us.</p>

<p>This disease is known as:</p>

<p><strong>CHOMPERISM</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>People talking through entire sets</li>
	<li>People competing with the band for volume</li>
	<li>People treating concerts like a bar with background noise</li>
	<li>People who somehow paid money to not listen</li>
</ul>

<h2>This is not normal. This is not acceptable.</h2>

<p>A concert is not your living room.</p>
<p>A concert is not your podcast studio.</p>
<p>A concert is not where your friend hears about your job.</p>

<p><strong>There is a band playing.</strong></p>

<h3>Chomping is not harmless.</h3>

<p>A single chomper can ruin a recording.</p>
<p>A group of chompers can destroy an entire experience.</p>

<p>For tapers, this is not annoying.</p>
<p>This is <strong>irreversible historical vandalism</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
"...and then my boss said—HAHAHA—no seriously—"
</blockquote>

<p>Congratulations. You are now part of the archive.</p>

<h2>The modern problem</h2>

<p>You cannot shut the fuck up.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Silence makes you uncomfortable</li>
	<li>You think every moment needs commentary</li>
	<li>You treat music like background noise</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn’t.</p>

<p><strong>You are the background noise.</strong></p>

<h2>The rules are simple</h2>

<ul>
	<li>If the band is playing, you are not the main character</li>
	<li>If you must talk, keep it short</li>
	<li>If it takes more than 10 seconds, save it</li>
	<li>If you ignore this, you are a chomper</li>
</ul>

<h3>We see you.</h3>
<h3>We hear you.</h3>
<h3>We wish we did not.</h3>

<h2>Intervention is justified</h2>

<p>There are stages:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The glance</li>
	<li>The polite request</li>
	<li>The direct "please shut the fuck up"</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not aggression.</p>
<p>This is <strong>preservation</strong>.</p>

<h2>You paid for the ticket.</h2>

<p>So did we.</p>

<p>But only one of us came to listen.</p>

<p>If you want to talk all night, go to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A bar</li>
	<li>The hallway</li>
	<li>Outside</li>
	<li>Literally anywhere else</li>
</ul>

<h2>This is a concert. Listen to it.</h2>

<p>Respect the artist.</p>
<p>Respect the audience.</p>
<p>Respect the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Respect the recording.</strong></p>

<h3>Yes, this is satire. But also not really.</h3>

<p>The problem isn’t concerts.</p>
<p>The problem is you.</p>

<h2>Final statement</h2>

<p><strong>END OF TRANSMISSION</strong></p>

<p>(please shut the fuck up)</p>
